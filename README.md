### [Genie 3: A new frontier for world models](https://deepmind.google/blog/genie-3-a-new-frontier-for-world-models/)

As a game design student and a game developer who's interested in finding ways that can be fastest and cheapest to acomplish a project. So what I found interesting about this article is how it frames world models not just as an AI research concept, but as a large-scale engineered system. Rather than focusing on individual model performance, the article emphasizes how Genie 3 is building a coherent, interactive simulation of environments. The technical part, researched and developed by Feifei Li is exciting as if there's a faster way to calculate physics colition and path finding through AI could solve some really annoying enemy building issues in Unity. (The current Mesh Navigation Unity built in really sucks. In the project I'm currently working on, when mesh is generated on the model it doesn't quite generating well, causing the model to walk under the pipe and then got stuck in the pipe.) Wish this new concept and further refinement, hopefully it will help with game developing faster and easier.
