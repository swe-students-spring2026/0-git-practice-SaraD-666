### [Genie 3: A new frontier for world models](https://deepmind.google/blog/genie-3-a-new-frontier-for-world-models/)

As a game design student and a game developer who's interested in finding ways that can be fastest and cheapest to acomplish a project. So what I found interesting about this article is how it frames world models not just as an AI research concept, but as a large-scale engineered system. Rather than focusing on individual model performance, the article emphasizes how Genie 3 is building a coherent, interactive simulation of environments. The technical part, researched and developed by Feifei Li is exciting as if there's a faster way to calculate physics colition and path finding through AI could solve some really annoying enemy building issues in Unity. (The current Mesh Navigation Unity built in really sucks. In the project I'm currently working on, when mesh is generated on the model it doesn't quite generating well, causing the model to walk under the pipe and then got stuck in the pipe.) Wish this new concept and further refinement, hopefully it will help with game developing faster and easier.

### Comment From Sunil Parab

I found this article really interesting as I didn't really know about the existence of world models. Genie 3 is a very impressive piece of technology and it's amazing what it can accomplish (and honestly a little scary to me as a game designer). While it would be a very long time before this sort of technology could really be used as part of a game, it could be argued that the technology by itself can be used as a game-like experience, where users can explore an interesting environment of their choosing. Overall this was a very interesting article to read and I'll likely try and keep up with developments involving world models.
